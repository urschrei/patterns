# Patterns
You'll need a recent Rust installation:
Go to https://www.rustup.rs, and follow the instructions.  

If you're on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#other-installation-methods).

Once Rust is installed:
- open a terminal, and in a local clone of this repo, run `CARGO_INCREMENTAL="0" cargo build --release`
- run `target/release/patterns words.txt`
    - if you'd prefer to use a different input corpus, specify its full path.

The number you see printed out is the number of "friendly" strings, i.e. those that have at least one matching pattern, according to the rules at https://mimi.io/en/challenge/

The `sha-256` hash of the text input file (`words.txt`, it's included in this repo) is:  
`aed3d37e660fe1714ccc42185ec5a0d0a3b6f17694e765a37e97fe93ee21717e`

# Benchmarks
The binary was compiled with link-time-optimisation.  
On a 3.4 GHz Core i7, the optimised version runs in **200 ms**.  

Optimisation details:
Wherever possible, operations are parallelised using the [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) library, and instead of the standard hash function, a hashing function based on the [Fowler-Noll-Vo](https://github.com/servo/rust-fnv) function is used. This is considerably faster than the default SipHash function for small integer keys, but is far less resistant to DoS attacks. Functions are explicitly inlined.
Total memory usage (heap and anonymous VM) on macOS is ~6.03 MiB.

A [Python implementation](patterns.py) runs in around 6800 ms.

## Time Complexity of the Rust implementation
`O(n)`. This is relatively easy to calculate, but we can verify it empirically. See the [notebook](stats.ipynb) for details.
